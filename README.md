# React Native Push Notification App â€“ Sakshi Gunjal

## Overview
This project is aimed at building a mobile application using React Native that supports real-time push notifications similar to WhatsApp calling alerts.

Since I currently do not have access to a laptop, I have prepared this conceptual submission to demonstrate my clear understanding of the assignment and intent to complete it fully when I have system access.

## ðŸ“± Features (Planned)
- Minimal React Native UI
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) integration
- Push notifications when triggered from backend
- Background and killed app notification support
- Native Android module via Java/Kotlin for better handling

---

## ðŸ’¡ Bonus (To be implemented)
- Deep linking to specific screen on notification click
- Local storage for notifications
- Basic backend simulation to trigger notifications

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- React Native
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- Java / Kotlin (native module)
- Node.js (for backend simulation)

---

## ðŸ“Œ My Plan
Once I gain access to a system, I will:
1. Set up the full React Native project
2. Integrate FCM for push notifications
3. Record and submit a working demo

Thank you for considering my submission.
